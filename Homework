Strings and integers are two fundamental data types in computer science and programming to represent different types of data.

Integers:
Definition: Integers are complete numbers without a decimal or fractional part. They are positive, negative, or zero.
Examples:
Positive integers: 1, 2, 42, 1000
Negative integers: -1, -15, -500
Zero: 0
Strings:
Definition: Strings are sequences of characters, which can have letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. They are employed to represent text.
Examples:
Simple strings: "Hello", "World"
Strings with numbers: "123", "4567"
Strings with spaces and punctuation: "Hello, World!", "I love programming."
Key Differences:
Nature: Integers are numeric data types and are utilized for mathematical operations, while strings are text-based and are utilized for representing textual data.
Operations: Integers can be utilized in arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), while strings can be concatenated (joined), sliced (accessing parts of the string), and manipulated in a number of ways.
# Variable 1: Integer
  age = 30 
  
# Variable 2: String
name = "Alice"

# Variable 3: Float
height = 5.7
Concatenation is the act of joining two or more strings end-to-end to form a single string. Concatenation in programming is normally carried out with the + operator or other specific functions depending on the programming language
# Define two strings
first_name = "Alice"
last_name = "Smith"

# Concatenate the strings
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# Print the result
print(full_name)  # Output: Alice Smith
